# Observer
# ----------------------------------------------
# A behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription 
# mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen 
# to the object theyâ€™re observing.
# Am observer is an object that whishes to be informed about
# events happening in the system. The entity generating the event is
# an observable.
# ----------------------------------------------
# Motivation:
# We need to be informed when certain things happen.
# - Object's property changes.
# - Object does something.
# - Some external event occurs.
# We want to listen to events and be notified when they occur.
# - Notifications should include useful data.
# Want to unsubscribe from events if we are no longer interested.
# ----------------------------------------------
# Summary:
# - Observer is an intrusive approach: an observable must
#   provide an event to subscribe to.
# - Subscription and unsubscription handled with addition/removal
#   of items in a list.
# - Property notifications are easy: dependent property 
#   notifications are tricky.
